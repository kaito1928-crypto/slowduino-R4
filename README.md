# Slowduino
## The Speeduino that runs anywhere
Slowduino is the fastest way to go from an inexpensive Arduino to a working EFI controller that plays nicely with the official Speeduino tooling. It keeps the same 16×16 maps, protocol, and tuning feel yet runs on an ATmega328p (Uno/Nano) while borrowing only the best ideas from the Speeduino firmware.

Slowduino is for DIY tuners, hobbyists, educators, and anyone who wants to build a full-featured ECU without the premium price tag. The project ships with ignition control, injection scheduling, sensor support, protective cut logic, and TunerStudio compatibility—everything you need to boot a motor in a garage, classroom, or lean workshop.

## Runs anywhere: the `tiny` branch
Most Speeduino-family firmware assumes an ATmega328p and its ~2 KB of RAM as the floor. Slowduino treats that as a starting point, not a limit — it's built to be squeezed down onto much smaller silicon without giving up the Speeduino protocol or the TunerStudio workflow you already know.

The **[`tiny`](../../tree/tiny)** branch is the proof: the same firmware, re-tuned to run in **587 bytes of RAM (28.7%)** on an unmodified ATmega328p — closing in on the 512-byte budget of the original MS1/Extra hardware (a Motorola 68HC908, not even an AVR, running hand-tuned assembly). It gets there by keeping VE/ignition tables in EEPROM instead of RAM, shrinking serial buffers, dropping the table-lookup cache in favor of recomputing on the fly, and cutting every dead field found along the way. It's an experimental, standalone variant (its own `.ini`, its own tuning chunk sizes — see [`documents/BRANCH_MS1_REDUCAO_RAM.md`](../../blob/tiny/documents/BRANCH_MS1_REDUCAO_RAM.md) for the full breakdown), meant for hobbyists targeting genuinely capped microcontrollers where every byte of RAM counts. The next lever toward 512 bytes isn't in the project code anymore — it's the ~140 bytes the stock Arduino core (`HardwareSerial`, `millis()`'s Timer0 bookkeeping) claims before a single line of Slowduino runs.

That's the point of Slowduino as a project: not "Speeduino on an ATmega328p," but Speeduino's ideas, ported down as far as the hardware will allow.

### Highlights
- Runs on **Arduino Uno/Nano** or Speeduino v0.4 hardware with the same peripheral set and protocol.
- **16×16 VE + Ignition tables**, closed-loop narrowband control, and Speeduino-style CRC pages for TunerStudio.
- Deterministic **Timer1-based scheduler** keeps ignition/injection timing inside 20 µs even at 8 000 RPM.
- Full sensor stack: MAP, TPS, CLT, IAT, O2, battery, oil pressure, fuel pressure, fan, pump, and IAC.
- **Engine protections** inspired by Speeduino (RPM cut + oil-pressure monitoring) that gate fuel and spark when you need them.
